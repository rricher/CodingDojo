**PROJECTS**
# Dungeons
Dungeons is a old school text based adventure RPG. I made Dungeons with Python (Django), HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript (JQuery). To really get the feel of an oldschool adventure game I designed the game based around mouse-less controls with a black and white color theme. I managed to get the game to run fluidly without the use of a gameloop, and used SQL to store user and mob data. I intend to continue work on Dungeons but I am satisified with the state it is currently in as a proof of concept.
